              The moose (Alces alces) is the largest species in the deer family, recognized by its long legs, broad, palmated antlers, and a distinctive hump on its shoulders. Native to North America, Europe, and Asia, they thrive in boreal and mixed deciduous forests. Moose are primarily solitary animals and are known for their incredible swimming abilities, often seen crossing lakes and rivers in search of food.

                Leopards (Panthera pardus) are large, solitary cats known for their distinctive spotted coats, which provide excellent camouflage. They are highly adaptable and can be found in a variety of habitats across Africa and parts of Asia. Leopards are agile climbers and often store their prey in trees to protect it from scavengers.
